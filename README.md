- **September 2011**: Qwikster split announcement (separate DVD/streaming companies)
- **Crisis Impact**: Lost 800K-2M subscribers, stock crashed 75% ($304 → $77), churn spiked from <1% to 7%+ monthly
- **Emergency Response**: Reversed Qwikster in 3 weeks, but price increase remained
- **Data-Driven Recovery**: Systematic cohort analysis revealed viewing behavior → retention correlation

- Build churn prediction models using behavioral leading indicators

### Crisis Mathematics
**Churn Compound Effects:**
- Pre-crisis: 0.87% monthly churn = 90% annual retention, $1,724 LTV
- Crisis peak: 7.02% monthly churn = 44% annual retention, $214 LTV
- Recovery: 2.50% monthly churn = 74% annual retention, $639 LTV
- **LTV destruction: 87% during crisis** (catastrophic business impact)

**Business Impact:**
- Subscribers lost: 2.4M (9% of base)
- ARR at risk: $153M annually
- Stock value destroyed: $12B market cap (75% crash)
- Recovery timeline: 5 months to pre-crisis subscriber levels

- `netflix_viewing_behavior.csv` - Individual viewing patterns during crisis
- `netflix_churn_analysis.csv` - Segment-level churn reasons
- `netflix_recovery_metrics.csv` - Pre/crisis/recovery comparisons

### Real-World Applications
- **Churn benchmarks**: SaaS B2B (5-7% annual), Consumer subscription (5-10% monthly)
- **LTV:CAC ratios**: <3:1 marginal, 3:1-5:1 healthy, >5:1 exceptional
- **Retention patterns**: Smiling curve (healthy), sliding curve (crisis), flat curve (exceptional)
- **Netflix recovery**: Content investment, personalization ($1B/year value), proactive interventions
