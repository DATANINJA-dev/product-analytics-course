    "### üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è What Are Pirate Metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "AARRR (pronounced \"Arrr!\" like a pirate) is a framework that breaks down the user lifecycle into five critical stages. Created by Dave McClure, it provides a systematic approach to growth optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Philosophy**: \n",
    "> \"Focus on the metrics that matter for sustainable growth, not vanity metrics that look impressive but don't drive business decisions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why AARRR Works\n",
    "1. **Sequential optimization**: Each stage builds on the previous one\n",
    "2. **Resource allocation**: Identify where to invest time and money\n",
    "3. **Bottleneck identification**: Find and fix conversion barriers\n",
    "4. **Growth sustainability**: Balance acquisition with retention and monetization\n",

    "## üöÄ The Five Stages of AARRR\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Acquisition** - How users find you\n",
    "**Question**: Which marketing channels deliver the highest quality users at sustainable cost?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Metrics**:\n",
    "- Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) by channel\n",
    "- Traffic volume and sources\n",
    "- Conversion rate from visitor to user\n",
    "- Channel attribution and lifetime value\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategic Focus**: Optimize marketing spend allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Activation** - First positive experience\n",
    "**Question**: What is the shortest path to demonstrating core product value?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Metrics**:\n",
    "- Activation rate (% users reaching \"aha moment\")\n",
    "- Time to activation\n",
    "- Onboarding completion rate\n",
    "- Feature adoption in first session\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategic Focus**: Reduce time to value and improve first experience\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Retention** - Users return and engage\n",
    "**Question**: How do we keep users engaged and coming back?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Metrics**:\n",
    "- Day 1, 7, 30 retention rates\n",
    "- Monthly/Weekly Active Users (MAU/WAU)\n",

    "- Cohort retention analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategic Focus**: Build habit-forming product experiences\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key Metrics**:\n",
    "- Viral coefficient (new users per existing user)\n",
    "- Referral conversion rates\n",
    "- Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n",
    "- Share/invite rates\n",

    "**Strategic Focus**: Build viral loops and word-of-mouth growth\n",

    "**Question**: How do we optimize for long-term business sustainability?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Metrics**:\n",
    "- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)\n",
    "- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)\n",
