This lab assignment challenges you to apply these frameworks to real business scenarios, demonstrating your ability to:\n\n- **Diagnose acquisition problems** using foundational metrics analysis\n- **Reveal hidden channel relationships** through multi-touch attribution\n- **Design strategic solutions** using portfolio optimization and capacity analysis\n- **Present executive-level recommendations** with confidence and analytical rigor\n\n### **Your Mission: Transform TechFlow's Acquisition Strategy**\n\n**TechFlow** is a B2B SaaS productivity platform facing the same challenges that nearly destroyed Dropbox in 2008. They have strong product-market fit (95% customer satisfaction), growing revenue (€2.4M ARR), but unsustainable customer acquisition economics.\n\n**The Crisis Situation:**\n- **Monthly Marketing Budget**: €125,000\n- **Current Blended CAC**: €380 per customer\n- **Average Customer Value**: €150/month (€1,800 annual)\n- **Current Payback Period**: 25+ months\n- **Board Pressure**: \"Fix acquisition economics or we reduce marketing budget by 60%\"\n\n**Your Role**: Senior Growth Analyst hired to diagnose the acquisition problems and design a strategic transformation plan.\n\n**Success Metrics**: Demonstrate acquisition mastery through systematic analysis and strategic recommendations that could achieve sustainable CAC reduction while maintaining growth velocity.\n\n---"
