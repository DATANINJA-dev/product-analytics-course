## Comparative Analysis Framework

### When to Use Each Framework

| Situation | Recommended Framework | Why |
|-----------|----------------------|-----|
| Early-stage startup | AARRR | Focus on growth fundamentals |
| Feature development | HEART | User-centric feature validation |
| Mature product optimization | North Star + HEART | Balance growth with satisfaction |
| Crisis/rapid change | Custom hybrid | Adapt to specific challenges |
| B2B SaaS | AARRR + Customer Health Score | Account-level metrics critical |
| Consumer social | Engagement + Retention focus | Network effects matter most |
| Marketplace | Supply/demand balance metrics | Two-sided optimization required |

### Cross-Framework Integration

**Successful companies use multiple frameworks simultaneously:**

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Framework Mapping
Choose a product you use daily and map out how you would apply all three frameworks (AARRR, HEART, North Star).

### Exercise 2: Metric Critique  
Review a public company's reported metrics. What are they optimizing for? What might they be missing?

### Exercise 3: A/B Test Design
Design an A/B test to improve one stage of Canva's conversion funnel. Define success criteria and potential risks.
