### **üìã Problem Statement: Why Product Analytics Frameworks? (5 minutes)**
**Time: 0:05 - 0:10**

**Content:**
- **The Problem**: Most companies track everything but measure nothing meaningful
- **Data Overwhelm**: 100+ metrics but no clear north star
- **Decision Paralysis**: Teams arguing over which metrics matter
- **Business Impact**: How wrong metrics lead to wrong product decisions

**Real Examples:**
- Startup that tracked 50 vanity metrics but missed churn warning signs
- Product team that optimized for page views instead of user value

**Key Insight:** *"You can't optimize what you can't measure, but measuring everything optimizes nothing"*

- Referral: Viral coefficient, referral conversion rate
- Revenue: LTV, MRR growth, revenue per user

**Interactive Element:** Ask Diogo to think of his product and identify one metric for each AARRR stage

- **R**etention: Rate of returning users
- **T**ask Success: Efficiency of user goal completion

#### **When to Use HEART (4 minutes)**
- **Best For:**
  - UX-focused products (Google, design tools)
  - Mature products optimizing experience
  - Products where user satisfaction drives retention
  - Complex products with multiple user flows

- **Not Ideal For:**
  - Early-stage products prioritizing growth
  - Simple products with obvious user paths
  - Products where revenue is primary concern

#### **Real Company Examples (5 minutes)**
- **Google**: How they measure search quality with HEART
- **YouTube**: Balancing engagement metrics with user satisfaction
- **Spotify**: Using HEART to optimize music discovery experience

#### **HEART Metrics Examples (3 minutes)**
- Happiness: NPS score, user satisfaction surveys, app store ratings
- Engagement: Session duration, interactions per visit, feature usage depth
- Adoption: Feature discovery rate, new feature activation
- Retention: Daily/weekly/monthly active users, churn rate
- Task Success: Completion rate, error rate, time on task

**Interactive Element:** Compare AARRR vs HEART for the same product - what different insights would you get?

### **üåü North Star Framework + Decision Tree (5 minutes)**
**Time: 0:40 - 0:45**

**Content Structure:**

#### **What is North Star? (2 minutes)**
- Single metric that captures core product value
- Aligns entire organization around one goal
- Leading indicator of long-term success
- Balances user value with business value

#### **North Star Examples (2 minutes)**
- **Spotify**: Time spent listening
- **WhatsApp**: Messages sent
- **Airbnb**: Nights booked
- **LinkedIn**: Monthly active professionals

#### **Framework Decision Tree (1 minute)**
```

### **üõ†Ô∏è Workshop: Framework Selection Exercise (20 minutes)**
**Time: 0:45 - 1:05**

**Exercise Structure:**

#### **Setup (2 minutes)**
Present 3 different product scenarios:
1. **New fintech app** (6 months old, pre-Series A)
2. **Established B2B SaaS** (3 years, 1000+ customers) 
3. **Consumer social platform** (Series B, engagement challenges)

#### **Individual Analysis (6 minutes)**
Diogo analyzes each product:
- What stage is the product in?
